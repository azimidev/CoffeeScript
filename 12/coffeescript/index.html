      <p>The Parsclick gets thousands of submissions every year for authors interesting in participating in the CAC exhibits, and selects approximately 200 distinct pieces of contemporary art for display in their collective exhibit.</p>
    <p>In addition, 12 individuals are honored as Featured Authors - each being granted his or her own exhibit hall to display entire collections or themed pieces. Each Featured Author has an opportunity to speak at the conference to share his or her vision, perspective, and techniques with conference attendees. It is truly an honor to be a CAC Featured Artist and many past students authors who were featured at CAC have gone on to brilliant careers in art.</p>

      <h1>About the venue</h1>
      <p>All CAC speaking events and technology exhibits take place inside Hotel Contempo, located at 309 1st Avenue, in Downtown Seattle. Just a walk to the beach, the Space Needle, and a diverse sampling of restaurants and shopping makes the venue a much sought-after location for gatherings and conferences, year after year.</p>

      <p>Hotel Contempo is the perfect spot for a gathering of modern artists. Not only are the conference rooms and halls decked with breathtaking contemporary art and sculptures, but the individual rooms are as unique as the renowned artists who were commissioned to decorate them. From the Ross Monroe Purple suite filled wall to wall with paintings in his signature palette of violet and lavender to the Tess Lessinger Sculpted Universe suite, with dozens of original sculptures, including the bronze-casted toilet, visitors are sure to be intrigued and comforted during their stay at Hotel Contempo. For those who opt to stay at another location, there is certainly no shortage of hotels in Downtown Seattle. Ranging from shabby chic to the ultimate in sophistication - there is a something to suit everyone's taste.
